# JAPAN101 - First-Year Japanese 1
### University of Waterloo
#### Spring 2018

Notes for JAPAN101R from University of Waterloo. The course was taught by Fumie Shimoda.

I may have several typos in the notes. I have corrected many of them, but some may have evaded me. The typos should be easy to spot and correct. They should not hinder the understanding of the material too much.

There was an additional tutorial on past-tense sentence structure. The notes for that will be posted at a later date.

##### TODO:
- [ ] Post tutorial content on past-tense.
